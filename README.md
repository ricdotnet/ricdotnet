### Hi, Ricardo here. ðŸ‘‹
<!-- #### Pleasure to have you visiting. -->

#### I'm a Full-stack web developer and develop bugs for a living.
#### If I write something without bugs (impossible), I will then go back and develop a few. What's fun in writing software that you then don't need to go back and fix?
#### I also like hunting in the night. I mostly hunt for bugs though.
