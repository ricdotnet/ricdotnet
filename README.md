#### bruh pls rate my code

<!--### Hi, Ricardo here. ðŸ‘‹
<!-- #### Pleasure to have you visiting. -->

I'm a Full-stack web developer and develop bugs for a living.<br>
If I write something without bugs (impossible), I will then go back and develop a few. What's fun in writing software that you then don't need to go back and fix?<br>
I also like hunting in the night. I mostly hunt for bugs though.

I have a strong opinion about Java... it is the best programming language.

<h3>Some bits and bobs that I use</h3>

- Jetbrains (Webstorm, Phpstorm, Intellij, GoLand... depends on which language I'm writing code)
- Vscode (Work tells me I have to)
- Alacritty, Tmux and NeoVim
- Moonlander keyboard (gotta keep my shoulders straight)
- Logitech Mx Master 3
- Macbook Pro 16 2019 (not an m1 sadly) and a Windows PC (It is beefy I promise)
- Macbook Pro 16 m1 (for work)
- Dell and Samsung monitors... connected via a usbc dell docking station to the macs
- Sony headphones, airpods and soundcore... whatever holds the most battery I will use for the day
- Ikea desk, and a good SecretLab chair
