### Hi, Ricardo here. ðŸ‘‹
<!-- #### Pleasure to have you visiting. -->

#### I'm a Full-stack web developer and develop bugs for a living.
#### If I write something without bugs (impossible), I will then go back and develop a few. What's fun in writing software that you then don't need to go back and fix?
#### I also like hunting in the night. I mostly hunt for bugs though.

<h3>Some bits and bobs that I use</h3>

- Jetbrains (Webstorm, Phpstorm, Intellij... I also dabble in go and python from time to time so I use Pycharm and Goland too for those)
- Vscode (with the vim extension)
- NeoVim (slowly transitioning to a 100% vim environment)
- Moonlander keyboard (gotta keep my shoulders straight)
- Logitech Mx Master 3
- Macbook Pro 16 2019 (not an m1 sadly) and Razer Blade Advanced Model 2018 (runs windows 11)
- Some Dell Monitors (S2718D and S2719DC... both have usb-c/thunderbolt to use with the mac and they also workd as usb hubs)
- A desk and a chair
- Steelseries Siberia Elite (pretty old I know)
